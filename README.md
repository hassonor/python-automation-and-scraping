1. You need a Gmail account.

2. You need to create an "App Password" for your Gmail account. 
   The normal password may also work, but sometimes it does not for security reasons.
   To create an app password follow these steps:

    - Turn on the 2-Step Verification option for your Gmail account on this the Google Account security page.
    - After turning on the 2-step verification, again on the security page, click over App Passwords and create an app and copy the password that will show on the screen after the app is created.

    - Keep that password ready to use in our scripts. ( I saved on .env file as PASSWORD="...")
